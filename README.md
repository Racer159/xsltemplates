 # XSL Templates
A simple repository containing a variety of simple XSL Templates for RSS Feeds, XML Documents and more.  These allow for the easy translation of XML-based documents into clean HTML code for viewing in the browser.

## Usage

At the top of your XML file, add the following line, corresponding to the XML document type that you are using.

`<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" media="screen" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Racer159/xsltemplates/master/rss.xsl"?>`

Once that is added, load up your XML document in the browser, and see the new styles!
